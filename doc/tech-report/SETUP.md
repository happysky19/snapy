# Setting up a machine for this report

```bash
cd doc/tech-report
bash setup.sh                     # the report: checks, figures, every gate, the HTML and the PDF
source .report-env/activate
```

That is the whole thing. Add `--with-native` to also build pydisort, pyharp, kintera and snapy at
their pins, which is what the `ctest` and do-card commands in the chapters need.

Nothing is installed system-wide: no package manager, no `sudo`, no write outside the prefix and the
repository. Every download is checked against the sha256 committed in `tools/env-pins.json` before it
is unpacked; a mismatch stops the run rather than installing the file.

## What it installs, and where each version comes from

| | version | pinned in | why that version |
|---|---|---|---|
| Python | 3.11–3.13 | `tools/env-pins.json` | torch 2.10.0 publishes no wheel below 3.11; CI uses 3.12 |
| numpy, sympy, matplotlib | 2.4.6, 1.14.0, 3.11.2 | `tools/requirements.txt` | the versions the report's committed numbers were produced with |
| torch | 2.10.0 | `tools/requirements.txt` | what the cards and data provenance record throughout |
| Quarto | 1.10.19 | `tools/env-pins.json` | `QUARTO_VERSION` of `.github/workflows/tech-report.yml` |
| TinyTeX | v2026.10, scheme 1 | `tools/env-pins.json` | the workflow asks `quarto-actions/setup` for `tinytex: true` |
| Universal Ctags | 6.2.1 | `tools/env-pins.json` | `CTAGS_VERSION` of the workflow and of `tools/code_anchors.py:50` |
| NetCDF | 4.9.3, built | `tools/env-pins.json` | `-DNETCDF=ON` in the snapy, pyharp and kintera builds |
| HDF5 | 1.14.6, built | `tools/env-pins.json` | netcdf-c is a thin layer over it, so both come from the pin or neither does |
| pydisort | 1.8.13 | `tools/env-pins.json` | the report pins no pydisort; `FindDisort.cmake` needs it importable |
| pyharp | `47217158` | `tools/package-pins.json` | the report's pin |
| kintera | `b6ad3739` (v2.6.3) | `tools/env-pins.json` | see "The two kintera revisions" below |
| snapy | `ccf40f95` | `code_pin.yml` | the report's pin |

`tools/requirements-linux-x86_64.lock.txt` is the exact Python closure verified on linux-x86_64;
install it instead of `tools/requirements.txt` when you need that environment byte for byte.

## Why `activate` sets so many cache variables

Because a read-only `$HOME` is normal on a shared or containerised host, and almost everything here
defaults its cache under `$HOME`. Left alone, LuaTeX stops before the first page with

```
luaotfload | load : FATAL ERROR
luaotfload | load :   × "luaotfload-init.lua:301: system : no writeable cache path, quiting".
```

and no PDF is produced. `tools/code_anchors.py:51`, `tools/check_provenance.py:126` and
`tools/check_citations.py:407` default to `~/.cache/...` the same way, and matplotlib and Jupyter do
too. `activate` points `TEXMFVAR`, `TEXMFCACHE`, `TEXMFCONFIG`, `TEXMFHOME`, `SNAPY_REPORT_CACHE`,
`XDG_*`, `MPLCONFIGDIR`, `IPYTHONDIR`, `JUPYTER_*`, `PIP_CACHE_DIR` and `TMPDIR` inside the prefix, so
none of them ever looks at `$HOME`. `IPYTHONDIR` matters more than it looks: every figure cell starts
an IPython kernel, and at the default each one warns twice that `~/.ipython` is not writable, which is
112 lines of warning in a full render and fails `render_gate.py`'s `stdout` gate.

It also sets `SNAPY_REPO` to a clone of `chengcli/snapy` at `code_pin.yml`, which `setup.sh` makes.
With it, `tools/code_anchors.py` resolves every `{{< code >}}` without touching the network; without
it, the tool fetches into `SNAPY_REPORT_CACHE` on every run.

## The two kintera revisions

`tools/package-pins.json` and `tools/env-pins.json` name different kintera commits on purpose.

- **`tools/package-pins.json`: `c55b13b2` (v2.6.2)** is the commit the chapters *cite*. 296 citations
  in 70 files resolve there, and `tools/ratchet_gate.py` counts any other kintera sha as `offpin`.
- **`tools/env-pins.json`: `b6ad3739` (v2.6.3)** is the commit that must be *installed*. snapy at
  `code_pin.yml` says, at `CMakeLists.txt:104`, `find_package(Kintera 2.6.3 REQUIRED)`, so v2.6.2
  cannot configure it:

  ```
  Could NOT find Kintera: Found unsuitable version "2.6.2", but required is at least "2.6.3"
    Reason given by package: snapy requires kintera >= 2.6.3 (... explicit kinetics rate constants
    from forward_with_rate_constants()), found 2.6.2
  ```

  v2.6.3 is the smallest revision at or above that floor — exactly one commit after the citation pin.

Until this report was audited there was one field for both questions, and it held v2.6.2, so no
native command of the report could be reproduced at the pins the report gives.

**The citation pin is still below the floor, and closing that is chapter work, not setup work.**
The reason is structural, not clerical: the commit that satisfies snapy's floor *is* the commit that
rewrote `src/kinetics/evaporation.cpp` and `src/kinetics/kinetics.cpp` — the explicit same-call rate
constants for the kinetics Jacobian — and chapter 10's kinetics section cites those files by line.
Every revision at or above the floor contains that rewrite, so no choice of revision avoids it.

`python3 tools/kintera_pin_migration.py` checks every kintera citation at both revisions and compares
the cited lines byte for byte. Against a clone holding both (`bash setup.sh --with-native` leaves one
in `.report-env/src/kintera`):

```
194 citation(s) found
  identical, the sha can simply be swapped : 180
  same code at new line numbers            :   4
  BLOCKED, the cited code is gone          :  10
```

The ten are eight in `book/chapters/10-moist-coupling/_kinetics.qmd` and two in
`reviews/code-anchors-unmapped*.tsv`. The tool prints each one with its file, line and cited range,
and exits 1 while any remains. Until a chapter owner re-reads those claims against v2.6.3, moving the
pin would either point at code that is not there or raise ch10's ratchet `offpin` count — a bare move
takes the total from 92 to 230 and fails nine chapters. The project's own rule for the snapy pin says
the same thing: `code_anchors.py bump` lists the cited symbols whose body changed so their claims can
be re-read. `python3 tools/check_env.py` reports the gap on every run so it stays visible.

## The pins are installed, not just written down

The default route **builds** the pinned NetCDF and the pinned HDF5 and then checks that `nc-config`
reports exactly the pinned version. It used to prefer whatever the machine already had and only build
when it found nothing usable, which meant the documented reproduction silently linked against a
different library on every host — 4.8.1 here against a 4.9.3 pin. A pin nobody installs is not a pin.

`bash setup.sh --allow-host-netcdf` is the deliberate opt-out. It still refuses anything below the
`minimum` in `tools/env-pins.json`, and it says in as many words that the result is not the
documented route.

## The TeX pin fails loudly or not at all

Every step that pins TeX is fatal: pointing `tlmgr` at the dated snapshot, `tlmgr`'s self-update from
that same snapshot, and the package install. After them `setup.sh` reads back the repository actually
in effect and compares it with the pinned one, so a silent fall-back to a default mirror cannot pass,
and a package the snapshot cannot serve stops setup and names itself.

That matters because carrying on is precisely what broke the PDF: a repository step that reported a
failure and continued let the render pull koma-script 3.49.3 from a rolling mirror.

`setup.sh` also records `tlmgr list --only-installed` in `.report-env/tex-packages.lock`, so "the
render fetched nothing" is checkable rather than assumed:

```bash
diff .report-env/tex-packages.lock <(tlmgr list --only-installed | sort)
```

Any difference is a package that arrived at render time. That check earned its keep immediately: a
full render pulled in `colortbl`, `fontawesome5`, `needspace` and `tikzfill` on its own. They came
from the pinned snapshot, so that render was still reproducible — but a package the setup step did
not install is a package whose version nobody chose, so all four are now named in
`tools/env-pins.json` and the lock is expected to be unchanged across a render.

## The native route

```bash
bash setup.sh --with-native
source .report-env/activate
```

adds pydisort, pyharp, kintera, `pinc` and snapy, each at its pin, and leaves the build in
`.report-env/snapy-pin/build` with `SNAP_PIN_BUILD` pointing at it. That is what the chapters'
`ctest` lines and the do-cards need.

Three things it has to get right, each of which silently did not work before:

- **CMake before pip.** Neither kintera's nor snapy's `setup.py` runs CMake. They link the Python
  extension against whatever is in `<src>/build/lib`, so with no CMake build there is nothing to
  link — and `pip install` still exits 0. The import is what fails, with
  `undefined symbol: _ZTIN7kintera17EquilibriumTPImplE`. Every package is therefore built, then
  installed, then **imported** to prove the wheel works.
- **`pinc`.** snapy defaults `PNETCDF=ON` on Linux (`CMakeLists.txt:14-18`) and
  `cmake/parameters.cmake:39` then refuses to configure without the Python package `pinc`. The
  report declares it nowhere, including in the configure line `README.md` prints for refreshing the
  test index. It is pinned in `tools/env-pins.json` at 0.2.0.
- **`SNAPY_TEST_PYTHONPATH`.** Without it CMake warns that the `*_python` ctests "will import the
  installed snapy, not this tree", and on a clean machine they all fail with `ModuleNotFoundError`.
  `setup.sh` points it at the environment it just installed snapy into.

`tools/requirements-build.txt` pins the four build-time requirements pyharp and kintera declare.
They are installed with `--no-build-isolation` so that they build against the pinned torch rather
than one pip fetches into a throwaway environment, which only works if those requirements are
genuinely present.

### Two documented commands this does not fix

They are the report's, not the environment's, and they are listed here so nobody mistakes them for
setup failures:

- `ctest --output-on-failure -E '^test_shallow_xy_decomp$'`, printed by eight chapter-15 section
  files, is not scoped to snapy. It sweeps in the Eigen suite the build fetches and reports **821
  failures out of 1054** — every one of them Eigen's own or the reference BLAS's, none of them
  snapy's. `README.md` already notes that Eigen's tests "are counted, not listed", so this wants a
  selector. **Chapter 15 is an excluded chapter** (see below); the command was run because it
  exercises snapy's code rather than the prose, and it yields no verdict on that chapter.

  `-R '^test_'` added to the same build gives **127 of 127 passed, exit 0**. That selector is mine,
  not the report's: it is a manually verified scoping of the documented command, offered as evidence
  that snapy's own tests pass, not as a committed fix.
- `run: ctest -R`, which names no test. Run verbatim it is `CMake Error: Invalid value used with
  -R`, exit 1. Four sites, at `ce725f672df68740d4c6cffc3d99a9bd74656eee`:

  | file:line | chapter |
  |---|---|
  | `book/chapters/04-spatial-discretization.qmd:85` | 04 — **excluded** |
  | `book/chapters/04-spatial-discretization/_fluxcov.qmd:334` | 04 — **excluded** |
  | `book/chapters/07-time-integration.qmd:49` | 07 |
  | `book/chapters/10-moist-coupling.qmd:60` | 10 |

### Authorship exclusions

Seven chapters are excluded from this audit as owner-authored: **03, 04, 06, 08, 12, 15, 16**.
Broad tooling unavoidably crosses them — the whole-book render, the figure manifest, the all-check
tooling run and the chapter-15 `ctest` line above all traverse excluded chapters. **Those executions
carry no verdict on an excluded chapter.** They are recorded here only so the leakage is visible.
`tools/chapter-owners.tsv` is a rewrite-owner lock, not a complete authorship register.

## Checking the numbers behind the figures

```bash
python3 tools/check_figure_data.py                 # every figure
python3 tools/check_figure_data.py --chapters ch05 # some chapters
python3 tools/check_figure_data.py --unmatched --unverifiable   # the full picture
```

Two SVGs can differ byte for byte and show the same curve, and a figure whose data drifted can keep
the same byte size. Hashing the SVG answers neither question, so this one asks about the numbers. It
draws each figure exactly as `tools/render_figures.py` does, with the same audit hook recording
which files the draw opened, and compares against `tools/figure-data-baseline.json`:

- **every series the figure plots**, by stored values. This catches a changed number wherever it
  came from — the data file, the figure module or a library.
- **which committed reference series the figure was found to be drawing, on which artist.** This
  catches a figure that quietly stops reading its committed data, or starts reading it somewhere
  else.

Neither half can be replaced by comparing a figure with its own data file: a figure that *reads*
that file moves with it, so perturbing the file makes the figure draw the perturbed value and the
two still agree. Only a committed reference stays put.

### Links and candidates

Only an **identity** reading counts as a link: this exact series, in this order, at this length, on
a named artist. Everything else — reversed, a slice, negated, absolute value, a unit factor — is
recorded as a **candidate** and is not provenance. A column can match a reversed x axis by
arithmetic coincidence while the figure never draws it, and that is what used to be counted. The
artist is stored with the link, so a reference moving from one curve to another on the same figure
is a change rather than a silent pass.

### Acceptance

Acceptance is the advertised `--rtol 1e-9` / `--atol 1e-12`, applied to the stored values. It is
deliberately **not** digest equality: quantising and comparing hashes puts a hard edge inside the
tolerance band, so `1.0000000004999` and `1.0000000005001` are within `rtol` of each other yet round
to different tenth digits. The digest is kept only as a fast path. Values are stored rounded to
twelve significant figures, three orders tighter than the default `rtol`, so storage never decides
an acceptance the tolerance would not.

Nonfinite values are kept in position. Filtering them per axis loses the pairing between x and y:
with `y = [1, NaN, 2, 3]` and `y = [1, 2, NaN, 3]` the surviving values are the same list, so
compacting them hides a moved point. A NaN matches only a NaN.

### It fails rather than passing quietly

A missing baseline, a figure in the baseline that was not drawn, a figure or numerical series that
appeared without being baselined, an unknown chapter selection and a selection that discovers
nothing are all **failures**. Missing coverage is not a pass; new coverage is read and baselined
deliberately with `--update`, not absorbed.

### What it still cannot do

- Of 145 figures, **16 read committed data**; 129 compute everything in the figure module, so there
  is no committed reference for them. `--unverifiable` lists them; they are never reported as
  passing. Their numbers are still stored, so drift in them is caught.
- Of 127 reference series, **80 are found in their figure** (66 identity links, 14 candidates) and
  47 are not. Those 47 are parameters, grid sizes and columns the figure does not draw, reported by
  `--unmatched` as information. A same-length plotted series is not evidence of intent.
- **The baseline is drift detection, not proof of historical equivalence.** It records this run
  against the current working tree: no source revision, no independently reviewed per-series oracle.
  Observing a file open proves access, not that its values produced a particular curve.

## The gate

```bash
python3 tools/check_env.py              # the committed pins are consistent and installable
python3 tools/check_env.py --installed  # also: what is importable clears snapy's floors
```

It fails when a pin is not a full sha, when an artifact has no url or no sha256, when a Python
requirement is not pinned with `==`, or when the kintera revision `setup.sh` installs is below the
floor the snapy pin declares. It is cheap, needs no network and no build, and exists because the
v2.6.2/2.6.3 contradiction was invisible to every gate the report already had: both files were
internally consistent and nothing compared the pair.

## What was and was not verified

Verified on linux-x86_64 (RHEL 9, glibc 2.34, GCC 11.5.0, Python 3.11.13, CPU only) from a fresh
clone with an empty prefix and empty caches:

| | |
|---|---|
| `bash setup.sh` | exit 0 |
| `bash setup.sh --with-native` | exit 0; pydisort 1.8.13, pyharp 2.7.6, kintera 2.6.3, pinc 0.2.0, snapy 2.11.12, torch 2.10.0+cu128, netCDF 4.9.3 |
| `python3 tools/check_env.py` | 5 passed, 1 reported, 0 failed |
| `python3 tools/code_anchors.py check` | 3552 citations, 793 distinct, 0 unresolved |
| `python3 -m pytest tools/tests -q` | see the branch's own run |
| the 77 `chNN/checks/*_check.py` | 77 run, exit 0 |
| `ctest -R '^test_' -E '^test_shallow_xy_decomp$'` | 127 of 127 passed, exit 0 |
| `ctest -R 'shallow_xy_decomp\|restart' --output-on-failure` | 6 of 6 passed, exit 0 |
| do-cards (`SNAP_PIN_BUILD=… pytest -rs tools/tests/test_do_cards_run.py`) | 60 passed, 0 failed |
| `python3 tools/render_gate.py book/` | HTML and PDF produced |
| `diff .report-env/tex-packages.lock <(tlmgr list --only-installed)` | unchanged: the render and the tests fetched no TeX package |

Not exercised, and not claimed:

- **The macOS and linux-aarch64 branches.** Their artifacts are in `tools/env-pins.json` with digests
  taken from the files those URLs serve, but the install path has only been run on linux-x86_64.
- **GPU.** This is a CPU machine. The 2 GPU do-cards, the chapter-14 GPU and bpp items and every
  CUDA ctest are untouched and remain GPU-only exclusions.
- **Multi-rank.** The 7 multi-rank cards need 2 ranks with `pd-run`/`pd-combine`/`pd-inspect`; they
  are not part of the CPU do-card runner.
- **The Eigen suite** that `ctest` fetches. It is third-party, it is not scoped out by the chapter-15
  command, and its 821 failures are not snapy's.
