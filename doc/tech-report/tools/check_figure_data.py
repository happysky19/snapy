"""Compare the numbers a figure plots with the numbers committed in the data it reads.

Two SVGs can differ byte for byte and still show the same curve: padding, canvas size and metadata
all move without a number changing. The opposite is worse and quieter -- a figure whose data file
has drifted draws a different curve at the same byte size. Neither question is answered by hashing
the SVG, so this asks the only one that matters: **does the figure plot the committed data?**

How it works. Each figure cell is drawn exactly as `tools/render_figures.py` draws it, with the same
audit hook recording which files the draw opened. That is live provenance: the data a figure reads
is observed, not declared. Every numeric series in the committed file is then looked for among the
series the figure actually plotted.

  series out of a file   CSV: every column, named by the `#` header when there is one.
                         JSON: every list of numbers, and every dict whose values are all numbers
                         (ordered by key, numerically when the keys are numbers). `provenance`
                         blocks are skipped -- they are strings and shas, not plotted values.
  series out of a figure Line2D x and y, scatter offsets, bar heights and their x positions,
                         image and mesh arrays, errorbar segments. Each is kept with the axes and
                         artist it came from so a mismatch can be pointed at.
  a match                some plotted series equals the reference series elementwise, within
                         tolerance, either over its whole length or as a contiguous slice of a
                         longer plotted series (a figure may draw a reference curve plus extra
                         points). Order is respected; a reversed series counts, because a plot may
                         run an axis backwards.

Tolerance, and why this one. The committed CSVs print ten significant digits
(`1.5625000000e-02`), so a value that was read from the file and plotted unchanged is exact, and a
value that was recomputed instead of read can differ by the text rounding, about 5e-11 relative.
The default `--rtol 1e-9` sits three orders above that rounding and seven orders below the loosest
tolerance the report states anywhere, so it accepts "the same number as committed, to the precision
committed" and rejects anything a reader would see. `--atol 1e-12` covers values at or near zero.
Both are reported in the output, and neither is per-figure: a figure that needs a looser one is a
finding, not a configuration.

What it does not do. It never writes a data file and never updates a baseline, so it cannot make a
mismatch disappear. A figure whose reference is missing is reported as such rather than passed.

    python3 tools/check_figure_data.py                      # every figure
    python3 tools/check_figure_data.py --chapters ch05,ch10 # some chapters

    python3 tools/check_figure_data.py --json out.json      # the full result

Exit 0 when every reference series was found in its figure, 1 when any was not.

    The values are stored because acceptance has to use the advertised rtol/atol, and a hash cannot.

    tolerance band: 1.0000000004999 and 1.0000000005001 are within rtol 1e-9 of each other, so the
    matcher accepts them, yet they round to different tenth digits and so hash differently. A check
    that accepts a pair in one place and rejects it in another is not one policy.

    Storage rounds to twelve significant figures, three orders tighter than the default rtol, so the
